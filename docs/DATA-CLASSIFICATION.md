# Data Classification & Privacy Inventory

> **Classification Date:** 2026-07-19  
> **Scope:** Pre-launch review per external code audit (engagement 2026-07-18).  
> **Threat Model:** Low PII footprint; no PHI, no PCI (Stripe holds card data).

## PII-Bearing Columns

### User Identity

- **`profiles.display_name`** (text)  
  User-chosen account name. Direct PII.
  - Cascade: deletes when `auth.users` is deleted ✓
  - Retention: N/A (cascades on account deletion)

- **`auth.users.email`** (managed by Supabase Auth)  
  Email address. Direct PII, managed by Supabase Auth and not in AoP's schema.
  - Retention: Subject to Supabase Auth's lifecycle; AoP does not manage.

### Device Push Tokens

- **`push_tokens.token`** (text)  
  Device-linked identifier (APNs/FCM). Sensitive: leaking enables targeted push/abuse and is intrinsically linked to a physical device.
  - Platform: `ios`, `android`, or `web`
  - Updated: server-side timestamp on each re-registration
  - Cascade: deletes when `auth.users` is deleted ✓ (references `auth.users (id) on delete cascade`)
  - RLS: Correctly restricted to own-row-only (user can only see/manage their own tokens)
  - Retention: **Defined (#574)** — auto-purge any token not re-registered for **90 days** (`updated_at` older than 90 days). `updated_at` is bumped on every registration and the client re-registers on each app start, so a stale row means the device has not opened the app in 90 days; the next launch re-registers it. Enforced by `public.purge_stale_push_tokens(retention_days integer default 90)` (`20260720004003_purge_stale_push_tokens.sql`); daily cron wiring is an operator follow-up (see that migration's scheduling note).

### Payment/Purchase Linkage

- **`entitlements.source`** (text)  
  Payment source identifier: `stripe`, `apple_iap`, `google_iap`, or `grant`. Reveals purchase origin and implies payment method.
  - Additional sensitive column: `entitlements.key` (e.g., `remove_ads`) indicates entitlement type.
  - Cascade: deletes when `profiles` is deleted (cascade from `auth.users`) ✓
  - Retention: **Define pre-launch**; tie to entitlement expiry or user consent timeline.

### User-Generated Content

- **`match_chat.body`** (text, 1–500 chars)  
  Chat message content, user-typed during in-match communication. Indirect PII (may contain slurs, strategy reveals, or personal mentions).
  - Channel: `all` (match-wide) or `alliance` (alliance-members-only)
  - Author: identified by `seat` (not direct user_id; seat references `match_players.user_id` indirectly)
  - **Cascade behavior:** `match_chat.match_id` cascades from `matches` on match deletion. **BUT:** when a user is deleted, `match_players.user_id` is set to NULL (not deleted); `match_chat` rows remain with stale seat associations.
  - **Retention:** **Define pre-launch** (recommendation: either purge all chat for a deleted user retroactively, or impose a TTL on `match_chat` rows regardless of user deletion).

## JSON Containers (Flagged for Verification)

### `matches.settings` (jsonb)

Game configuration container per `docs/MULTIPLAYER.md §3`. Stores:

- `mapSize` — map generation parameter
- `maxPlayers` — seat count
- `turnTimerSeconds` — turn time limit (seconds) or `null`
- `betrayalTruceRounds` — host-chosen betrayal window
- `captainCaptivityRounds` — host-chosen captivity window
- `topology` — grid topology selector
- `roundLimit` — host-chosen round cap

**PII Review:** None observed. Container holds only game parameters; no user names, emails, or device identifiers. Safe to denormalize.

## Deletion Cascade Summary

### When `auth.users` is deleted:

1. ✓ `profiles` row deleted (cascade from auth.users)
2. ✓ `push_tokens` rows deleted (cascade from auth.users)
3. ✓ `entitlements` rows deleted (cascade from profiles)
4. ✓ `match_players.user_id` set to NULL (on delete set null)
5. ✓ `matches.created_by` set to NULL if user created a match (on delete set null)
6. ✓ `match_spectators.granted_by` set to NULL if user granted spectator access (on delete set null)
7. ⚠️ `match_chat` rows persist with stale seat associations (no cascade behavior)

### Verified by:

- `20260707070003_account_deletion_fk_cleanup.sql` (match_players, matches, match_spectators FK updates)
- `20260702000000_initial_schema.sql` (profiles, entitlements cascade)
- `20260705000003_push_tokens.sql` (push_tokens cascade)

## Findings & Gaps

### Critical

- **`match_chat` retention on user deletion:** When a user is deleted, their chat messages remain in the database, orphaned (author's `match_players` row is set to NULL, breaking the semantic link). This may violate GDPR/CCPA right-to-erasure expectations. **Action:** Either (a) add a retroactive purge of all `match_chat` rows authored by a deleted user, or (b) implement a TTL on chat (e.g., purge after 30 days regardless of user status).

### Medium

- **Push-token retention policy — RESOLVED (#574):** Tokens are auto-purged when not re-registered for **90 days**. `push_tokens.updated_at` (bumped server-side on each registration; the client re-registers on every app start) is the freshness signal, so a stale row means the device has not opened the app in 90 days. Enforced by `public.purge_stale_push_tokens()` in `20260720004003_purge_stale_push_tokens.sql`; the daily cron wiring is an operator follow-up (see that migration's scheduling note). This bounds the stored device-identifier footprint to active devices.

- **Entitlements retention policy:** No documented retention window. Payment history is retained indefinitely. **Action:** Define a retention policy (e.g., purge after 1 year, or after entitlement expiry + N days for audit/chargeback).

### Low

- **Match-chat content moderation:** No documented moderation or PII-filtering policy for user-generated chat. Users could inject personally identifiable information into messages. **Action:** Document the moderation strategy (manual review, auto-filter, or acceptance of user responsibility).

## Recommendations Before Launch

1. **Implement chat deletion on user deletion:** Add a migration to enforce `match_chat` rows deletion (or mark for anonymization) when the associated `match_players` row is deleted.
2. ~~**Define push-token retention:**~~ **Done (#574)** — auto-purge tokens not re-registered for 90 days (`purge_stale_push_tokens()`); operator to wire the daily cron.
3. **Define entitlements retention:** Set a policy (e.g., purge 1 year after grant or expiry).
4. **Update DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) workflow:** Document which tables are included in export (confirm chat and push tokens are exported or excluded intentionally).
5. **Document user-content moderation:** Clarify whether match chat is moderated, filtered, or stored as-is.
